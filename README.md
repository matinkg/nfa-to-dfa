# NFA to DFA Converter

This is a web-based tool for converting Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). The converter provides both a visual representation and a JSON format of the automata.

## Demo

A demo of the NFA to DFA Converter is available at [Demo](https://matinkg.github.io/nfa-to-dfa/).

## Getting Started

To use the NFA to DFA Converter, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser or deploy it on a web server. The tool allows you to interactively build and convert automata.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Interactive NFA Building:**
  - Add states, transitions, accept states, and set the start state.
  - Remove states, transitions, and accept states.
  - Clear the NFA.

- **Export and Import:**
  - Export the current NFA configuration to a JSON file.
  - Import a previously exported NFA configuration.

- **Visual Representation:**
  - See a visual representation of the NFA and DFA.
  - Use SVG graphics to display states, transitions, and accept states.

- **Conversion to DFA:**
  - Convert the NFA to a DFA with a single button click.
  - View the DFA in both JSON and visual representation formats.

- **Dtrans Table:**
  - Display the transition table (Dtrans Table) during the conversion process.

## Instructions/Help

1. Add states, transitions, and set the start state in the NFA section.
2. Explore additional features such as clearing, exporting, and importing.
3. Use "epsilon" as a symbol for Îµ transitions.
4. Convert NFA to DFA using the "Convert NFA to DFA" button.
5. Review the DFA in the visual representation and JSON format.
6. Experiment with different automata configurations.

## Known issues

- <del>The converter will crash if there are loop epsilon transitions in the NFA.</del>
